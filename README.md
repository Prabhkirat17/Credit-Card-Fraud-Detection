Credit Card Fraud Detection : 
A machine learning project designed to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced classification algorithms.

Project Overview : 
This project aims to build a reliable and efficient system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing patterns in the provided dataset, the model distinguishes between genuine and fraudulent activities, ensuring higher accuracy and fewer false positives.

Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data to handle missing values, imbalanced datasets, and feature scaling.
2. Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features to improve the model's ability to detect fraud.
3. Model Selection and Evaluation: Compares multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
4. Imbalanced Dataset Handling: Employs techniques such as SMOTE and class weighting to address imbalanced data.
